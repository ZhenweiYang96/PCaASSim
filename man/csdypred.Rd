\description{
This function allows you to predict patient-specific risk of cancer progression based on the fitted MCICJM with a given sensitivity parameter. \cr
The prediction can be dynamically updated with new PSA values. The sensitivity parameter can be chosen from \{0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75. 0.8, 0.85, 0.9\}.
}
\details{
The prediction of cancer progression are based on seven MCICJMs fitted on the Canary PASS data with fixed biopsy sensitivity ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 (with a step of 0.05). According to the user-specified sensitivity in the above-mentioned range, the corresponding MCICJM is chosen as the training model. \cr
This function can only generate predictions based on a dataset containing only ONE patient. This facilitates the users to make prediction in parallel (e.g., using packages \code{doParallel} or \code{future}) if they have larger datasets.
